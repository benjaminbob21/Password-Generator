# Password Generator Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator! This simple Python script allows you to generate strong and customizable passwords based on your preferences. Whether you need a secure password for your online accounts or want to enhance your digital security, this project has got you covered.

## Features
- Customize the length of your password.
- Choose the number of symbols and numbers to include for added complexity.
- Generate unique passwords with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers when prompted.
3. Receive a strong and randomized password tailored to your specifications.
## How it Works
The password generation involves three steps:

- **Selecting Letters:** Random letters are chosen from a pool of uppercase and lowercase alphabets.
- **Adding Symbols:** A specified number of symbols are added to increase password complexity.
- **Incorporating Numbers:** A designated number of numerical digits are included for further security.
## Examples
### Easy Level (Order not randomized)
For example, if you choose 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, the generated password might look like:
JduE&!91
### Hard Level (Order of characters randomized)
The same configuration could yield a randomized password like:
g^2jk8&P
# Note
- Ensure you remember or store the generated password securely as it is not recoverable.
Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or customize the script further based on your preferences. Enhance your online security with strong and unique passwords generated by the PyPassword Generator! Enjoy coding!
